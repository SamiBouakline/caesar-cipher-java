# Caesar Cipher Suite (Java)

A Java project exploring classical encryption and cryptanalysis 
through the implementation of a Caesar cipher system.

## Overview
This project was built to understand how simple ciphers work and 
why they are vulnerable to analysis. It demonstrates encryption, 
key recovery, and the practical limitations of substitution ciphers.

The goal was to practice **Java programming**, **algorithmic thinking**, 
and **statistical reasoning** in a small interactive application.

## Features
- Encrypt plaintext using a randomly chosen Caesar shift
- Recover plaintext using brute-force over all possible shifts
- Estimate the encryption key using letter frequency analysis
- Demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of classical ciphers

## Technical Concepts
- Java file I/O and string processing
- Modular arithmetic for character shifting
- Brute-force vs heuristic key recovery
- Applying statistical analysis to classical ciphers

## How to Run
Compile and run with a single command:
```bash
javac *.java && java Encrypt
