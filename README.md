# Caesar Cipher Suite (Java)

An educational Java project demonstrating Caesar cipher encryption and
basic cryptanalysis techniques.

## Programs Included
- Encrypt: Encrypts plaintext using a random Caesar shift
- BruteForce: Tries all 25 possible keys
- FrequencyAnalysis: Estimates key using letter frequency

## Concepts Demonstrated
- File I/O
- Character encoding
- Modular arithmetic
- Basic cryptanalysis techniques

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only.
Caesar ciphers are not secure and should not be used in real applications.
